        <p>The inspiration for Fred the Baker to create this virtual Donut Maker Clicker game came from his love as
          a child of the Cookie Clicker game, where a user could click on a cookie which would subsequently create 
          a single cookie.  Additionally, the game had the option to purchase assets such as "cursors" and "buildings",
          which would automatically produce cookies.  Fred the Baker wanted to throw his unique twist on this Cookie Clicker
          Classic utilizing his love for donuts and created the Donut Maker Clicker game where users can click to create donuts 
          and also have the ability to produce "auto clickers" and "multipliers", which automatically create donuts and add additional 
          donuts, respectively.  He hopes you enjoy this game and develop the same love for donuts that he has.
